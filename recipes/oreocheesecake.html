    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Oreo Cheesecake is a decadent and indulgent dessert that combines the
      creamy richness of classic cheesecake with the irresistible flavor of Oreo
      cookies. The base of the cheesecake is typically made from crushed Oreo
      cookies mixed with melted butter, creating a firm and flavorful crust. The
      filling is a luscious blend of cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract,
      with the addition of crushed Oreo cookies folded into the mixture. This
      creates a velvety and smooth texture punctuated by delightful bursts of
      cookie goodness.

      With its harmonious combination of creamy cheesecake and the beloved
      chocolatey crunch of Oreo cookies, Oreo Cheesecake is a true delight for
      dessert enthusiasts. Each bite offers a delightful contrast of textures,
      from the velvety smoothness of the cheesecake filling to the satisfying
      crunch of the Oreo cookie crust.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 cups (about 200 grams) of crushed Oreo cookies (with the cream
        filling)
      </li>
      <li>5 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>24 ounces (about 680 grams) of cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 grams) of granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>
        1 cup (about 100 grams) of crushed Oreo cookies (with the cream filling)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) to ensure it's
        ready when you're done preparing the cheesecake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the crust: In a bowl, combine the crushed Oreo cookies and
        melted butter until well mixed. Press the mixture into the bottom of a
        9-inch (23 cm) springform pan, creating an even layer. Place the pan in
        the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the cheesecake filling: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened
        cream cheese, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract together until
        smooth and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
        addition. Fold in the crushed Oreo cookies until evenly distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble and bake: Pour the cheesecake filling over the chilled crust in
        the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Place the pan in the
        preheated oven and bake for about 55-60 minutes, or until the center is
        set and the edges are slightly golden. The cheesecake will still jiggle
        slightly in the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add toppings (optional): Prior to serving, you can top the cheesecake
        with whipped cream and sprinkle additional crushed Oreo cookies for
        garnish if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve and enjoy: Carefully remove the sides of the springform pan and
        transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate. Slice and serve chilled.
        Oreo Cheesecake is best enjoyed when it has been properly chilled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and chill: Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool
        completely at room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake
        for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow it to firm up and develop its
        flavors.

    </ol>
